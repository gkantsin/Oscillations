# Oscillations

Oscillations is a python library i am working on. It is a simple simulation of oscillating motion. It is a great way to refresh my physics knoledge and practice 
some coding.

<h2>Goals:</h2>

  - Add Degressive Oscillations
  - Add 1st and 2nd type of composit oscillations
  - Add a visual representation of them ( maybe with pygame )
  - Clean up the code and add comments
